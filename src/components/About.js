        Artists often use large notebooks, which include wide spaces of blank
        paper appropriate for drawing. Similarly composers utilize notebooks for
        writing their lyrics. Lawyers use rather large notebooks known as legal
        pads that contain lined paper (often yellow) and are appropriate for use
        on tables and desks. These horizontal lines or "rules" are sometimes
        classified according to their space apart with "wide rule" the farthest,
        "college rule" closer, "legal rule" slightly closer and "narrow rule"
        closest, allowing more lines of text per page. When sewn into a
        pasteboard backing, these may be called composition books, or in smaller
        signatures may be called "blue books" or exam books and used for essay
        exams. Various notebooks are popular among students for taking notes.
        The types of notebooks used for school work are single line, double
        line, four line, square grid line etc. These notebooks are also used by
        students for school assignments (homeworks) and writing projects. In
        contrast, journalists prefer small, hand-held notebooks for portability
        (reporters' notebooks), and sometimes use shorthand when taking notes.
        Scientists and other researchers use lab notebooks to document their
        experiments. The pages in lab notebooks are sometimes graph paper to
        plot data. Police officers are required to write notes on what they
        observe, using a police notebook. Land surveyors commonly record field
        notes in durable, hard-bound notebooks called "field books." Coloring
        enthusiasts use coloring notebooks for stress relief. The pages in
        coloring notebooks contain different adult coloring pages.[9] Students
        take notes in notebooks, and studies suggest that the act of writing (as
        opposed to typing) improves learning.[10] Notebook pages can be recycled
        via standard paper recycling. Recycled notebooks are available,
        differing in recycled percentage and paper quality.
